## About

**Cars4Sales** is an under development.

<p>It is an application to register cars for sale.</p> 
<p>You will be able to display an Image, Make-Model, Year, License Plate and the vehicle's color.</p>

<p>The <b>Company name</b> and <b>Phone number</b> are being retrieved by an ajax object created using <b>XMLHttpRequest)()</b> and we are getting the response in <b>JSON.</b>
<p>A REST API was created (<b>server with node express</b>).</p>
<p>Data is saved temporarily in the server's memory.</p>
<p>We can add cars by filling out the fiels and clicking in 'Cadastrar' - [POST Method]</p>
<p>We can delete cars and this is applied on the Frontend only by now.</p>
<p>Backend validations will be applied to prevent duplicated records.</p>
<p>Responsive page @media query - When page's width is less than 850px, the input fields are displayed in Columns</p>
