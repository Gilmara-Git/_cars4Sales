## About

<p><b>Cars4Sales</b> is an application to list cars for sale.</p> 
<p>You will be able to display a car's Image, Make-Model, Year, License Plate and the vehicle's color.</p>

<p>The <b>Company name</b> and <b>Phone number</b> are being retrieved by an ajax object created using XMLHttpRequest().</p>
<p>A REST API was created (<b>server with node express</b>).</p>
<p>Data is saved temporarily in the server's memory.</p>
<p>You can register cars by filling out the fields and clicking in 'Cadastrar' - [POST Method]</p>
<p>Backend validations were applied to prevent duplicated records.</p>
<p>You can delete cars and this is applied on the <b>Frontend</b> and <b>Backend</b>, meaning when the page reloads, actual data is shown.  - [DELETE Method]</p>

<p>Responsive page with @media query - When page's width is less than 850px, the input fields are displayed in Columns</p>
<p>Linear Gradient effect applied.</p>
