## About

**Cars4Sales** is an under development.

<p>It is an application to register cars for sale.</p> 
<p>You will be able to display an Image, Make-Model, Year, License Plate and the vehicle's color.</p>

<p>The <b>Company name</b> and <b>Phone number</b> are being retrieved by an ajax object created using <b>XMLHttpRequest)()</b> and we are getting the response in <b>JSON.</b>
<p>A REST API was created (<b>server with node express</b>).</p>
<p>Data is saved temporarily in the server's memory.</p>
<p>You can register cars by filling out the fields and clicking in 'Cadastrar' - [POST Method]</p>
<p>Backend validations were applied to prevent duplicated records.</p>
<p>You can delete cars and this is applied on the Frontend and Backend, meaning when the page reloads, actual data is shown.  - [DELETE Method]</p>
<p>There will be an option to edit/update a car record</p>
<p>Responsive page @media query - When page's width is less than 850px, the input fields are displayed in Columns</p>

## Motivation

Practie API requests using Ajax, add the event "readystatechange" to it, analyze its "stauts", "readyState" and manipulate its "response".
<p>Practice working with 'lib DOM' to manipulate DOM elements.</p>

## API used:

A local API was created to simulate the request for company 'data'.
